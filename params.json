All artifacts required for bringing together Ext JS, Java implementations of [ Ext.Direct](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/extdirect) (currently - [DirectJNGine](http://code.google.com/p/directjngine/)), [BlazeDS](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/blazeds/BlazeDS), and popular Java frameworks: [Spring](http://www.springsource.org/), [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/docs), and [MyBatis](http://mybatis.org/) CDB-H generates automatically. \r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/13PgRSs2At0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n[Source code](https://cleartoolkit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cleartoolkit/trunk/) is hosted on the SourceForge as part of the [Clear Toolkit Project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cleartoolkit/) under [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php). Commercial support of CDB-H is available from the source: [Farata Systems](http://www.faratasystems.com). \r\n\r\nIntrigued? Check our [getting started guide](https://github.com/Farata/ClearJS/wiki/Getting-started-ClearDataBuilder-for-Ext-JS-4.1) in wiki\r\n\r\n## Why Clear Data Builder?\r\n\r\nIf your ever tried to create a combined Ext-JEE-DBMS project with or without Spring, you spent hours just to see a window populated with the simple data. Implementing data persistence and transaction processing is even more time consuming. How about batching all inserts, deletes and and updates done to your store as a single transaction? Want to incorporate changes to the associated stores to the same _sync()_? CDB-H substantially saves time by automating most of these efforts. \r\n\r\nYou go through a set of simple steps to _declare_ what data do you need (using SQL or Hibernate) and let CDB-H _generate_ and _deploy_ all the artifacts: Java, JavaScript and configuration files. Below, _getCompanyAssociates_ is annotated to return all records from a _company_associate_ table1) and this declaration is all you write to build a BlazeDS service that returns a collection of employee data ([Run view-source enabled demo)](): \r\n\r\n\tpackage com.farata.test.service;\r\n\timport java.util.List;\r\n\timport com.farata.test.entity.CompanyAssociate;\r\n\timport clear.cdb.annotations.*;\r\n\t\r\n\t@JSService\r\n\tpublic interface ICompanyService {\r\n\t\t@JSJPQL(query=\"SELECT a FROM CompanyAssociate a WHERE companyId=:companyId\")\r\n\t\tList<CompanyAssociate> getCompanyAssociated(Integer companyId);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThrow in one more Java annotation to generate a sample HTML application:\r\n\r\n\t@JSGenerateHTML5(arguments=\"1\")\r\n\t@JSJPQLMethod(query=\"SELECT a FROM CompanyAssociate a WHERE companyId=:companyId\")\r\n\tList<CompanyAssociate> getCompanyAssociated(Integer companyId);\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
