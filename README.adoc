Clear Data Builder for Ext JS
-----------------------------

Clear Data Builder for Ext JS (CDB) is a free and open source 
productivity tool to build applications with HTML5, JavaScript and Java EE technologies.

It supports http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/[Ext JS] with http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/extdirect[Ext.Direct]/JEE.

CDB for ExtJS writes both JavaScript and Java code for you.
All artifacts required for bringing together Ext JS, Java implementations of http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/extdirect[Ext.Direct] (currently - http://code.google.com/p/directjngine/[DirectJNGine]), and popular Java frameworks: http://www.springsource.org/[Spring], http://www.hibernate.org/docs[Hibernate], and http://mybatis.org/[MyBatis] ClearJS generates automatically.

Commercial support of ClearDataBuilder is available from the source: http://www.faratasystems.com[Farata Systems].

== Why Clear Data Builder?

If your ever tried to create a combined Ext-JEE-DBMS project with or
without Spring, you spent hours just to see a window populated with the
simple data. Implementing data persistence and transaction processing is
even more time consuming. How about batching all inserts, deletes and
and updates done to your store as a single transaction? Want to
incorporate changes to the associated stores to the same `sync()`?
ClearJS substantially saves time by automating most of these efforts.

You go through a set of simple steps to `declare` what data do you need
(using SQL or Hibernate) and let ClearJS `generate` and `deploy` all the
artifacts: Java, JavaScript and configuration files. Below,
`getCompanyAssociates` is annotated to return all records from a
`company_associate` table1) and this declaration is all you write to
build a service that returns a collection of employee data:

[source,java]
----
package com.farata.test.service;
import java.util.List;
import com.farata.test.entity.CompanyAssociate;
import clear.cdb.annotations.*;

@JSService
public interface ICompanyService {
    @JSJPQL(query="SELECT a FROM CompanyAssociate a WHERE companyId=:companyId")
    List<CompanyAssociate> getCompanyAssociated(Integer companyId);
}
----

Throw in one more Java annotation to generate a sample HTML application:

[source,java]
----
@JSGenerateHTML5(arguments="1")
@JSJPQLMethod(query="SELECT a FROM CompanyAssociate a WHERE companyId=:companyId")
List<CompanyAssociate> getCompanyAssociated(Integer companyId);
----
